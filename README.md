Login, N. (TBA). Wrong answers only: Distractor generation for Russian reading comprehension questions using learner corpus data. <i> Journal of Language and Education </i> (In print)

NOTICE: The metrics reported in working notebooks were not always calculated appropriately: Sentence-level BLEU (instead of corpus-level BLEU) and ROUGE implementation that does not support Russian were used during initial experiments. Task-appropeiate metric values are calculated and reported in <b>output_analysis/RecalculateMetrics.ipynb</b> notebook.
