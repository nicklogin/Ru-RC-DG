It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

I want to cry because I feel sorry for myself, and I feel sorry for those who sleep in the graveyard! Wasa continued to play, saying: \"This music was written by a man who had been deprived of the most precious one. If a man has no mother, no father, but a homeland, he\\'s not an orphan yet. Everything goes by: love, regret, grief, even pain from wounds — but it never goes away, and it doesn\\'t go away. This music was written by my countryman Oginsky. He wrote at the border saying goodbye to his motherland. He sent her last hello. There has been no composer in the world for a long time, but his pain, his sorrow, love for his own land, which no one can take away, is still alive.\" \"Thank you, Uncle,\" I whispered. \"Why, boy?\" \"I\\'m not an orphan.\" I thanked Vasia, the world of night, the sleeping village, and the forest that sleeps behind him. I wasn\\'t angry at those moments. The world was kind and lonely as I was. Enisey, who does not even sleep at night, a silent village behind my back, a grasshopper who last worked against the fall in a splinter pouring metal, was my homeland. It\\'s been many years. And one day, at the end of the war, I stood by the guns in a destroyed Polish city. It smelled like smoke, dust. And suddenly, in a house across the street from me, there was a sound of an organ. That music sorted out memories. I once wanted to die of incomprehensible sadness and excitement after listening to Oginsky\\'s story. But now the same music that I was listening to when I was a kid broke into me and buried it, especially that part of it that I used to cry from. Music, like that long night, grabbed her throat, but she didn\\'t squeeze tears, and she didn\\'t grow in pity. She called out, made me do something to put out these fires, to keep people from living in burning ruins, so the sky wouldn\\'t blow up. The music had dominated a troubled city, the music that, like the breath of its land, had been stored in the heart of a man who had never seen his homeland and had longed for it all his life.* Victor Petrovich Astafiev (1924), an outstanding Russian prosaic.
